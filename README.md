# Loop-Machine
works like a loop pedal, allowing you to layer different loops of audio over one another.


I was asked to build a loop machine that contains 9 different beats of music.

The time of each beat is 8 sec.

A machine that allows the user to unite different melodies, and create a "mix ."

Definition of Mix -

When the user clicks on more than one melody, a fusion of different beats is created.

It should be noted that a specific melody type can be played on the machine once each time, meaning that the same beat cannot be selected more than once. I created a 

user-friendly interface, which can mix beats by clicking on the letters below in yellow. When the user clicks on a letter, the beat name is displayed in the top square 

shown in blue.

After pressing the same rhythm again, the music will stop.

The user can stop the beats he created at any time by pressing the pause button. And when he clicks on the play button, the beats will be active from the exact point 

where he stopped.

When you click play, there is a delay of 3 seconds in order to create a user experience of cycle time.

At each time the rhythm cycle "runs" again.
